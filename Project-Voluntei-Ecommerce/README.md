## What is Voluntei?
Voluntei was born from the idea of â€‹â€‹combining the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp with volunteer work, connecting information technology volunteers to non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The objective is to develop NGO websites, giving them greater visibility on the internet and improving our volunteers professionally.

## ðŸ’» Project
In this Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp final project, we chose to develop an e-commerce with products created by Voluntei's UX / UI team.
