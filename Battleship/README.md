# Battleship
First Ironhack Project - Module 1

Time line: GAMES is a guessing game for one player, based on the classic battleship game. However, in this game the player is not attacked by any opponent. The player has 20 moves to shoot down the five vessels hidden in the grid, which can be done in 15 shots. The maximum score of the game is 30 points, which corresponds to one point per correct shot and 15 points of the sunken vessels.

## Game instructions:

The player must attack each enemy vessel by clicking on the chosen square point using a mouse or a touchpad.

There will be 20 chances to destroy the five vessels.

Every right shot is worth one point.

Each vessel is worth the number of houses it occupies.

## Unsolved problems and future improvements:

The project was originally thought to be a two-player game, but due to difficulties in crafting the HTML and CSS interaction with Javascrip, it was decided to convert it into a single player game.
The code will be converted to ECMAScript 6 format and made more concise.

As in the traditional game, there will be two grids so that the player can position their vessels and be attacked by a second player or by the computer.

It is necessary to elaborate the functions and strategies that the computer will use to attack the player.

There will also be three different levels of difficulty to be chosen by the player in the single player option.

Finally, the game will be visually improved.
